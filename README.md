## 🚀 Quick Installation

### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
cd ~
git clone <your-repository> cursor-config
# or if you don't have a remote repo yet:
# Repository already created at ~/cursor-config
```

### 2. Configure useful aliases
Add to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# Cursor Rules - Aliases
alias cursor-sync="~/cursor-config/scripts/sync-rules.sh"
alias cursor-link="~/cursor-config/scripts/link-rules.sh"
alias cursor-setup="~/cursor-config/scripts/setup-project.sh"
alias cursor-update="~/cursor-config/scripts/cursor-update-rules.sh"
alias cursor-edit="cursor ~/cursor-config/rules"
```

Reload terminal:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

## 📖 How to Use

### 🔄 Option 1: Synchronization (Copy)
Ideal for team projects where you want to version rules with code:

```bash
# In your project directory
cursor-sync

# Or specifying a directory
cursor-sync ~/projects/my-project
```

### 🔗 Option 2: Symlink (Recommended)
Ideal for personal development - rules are always automatically updated:

```bash
# In your project directory
cursor-link

# Or specifying a directory
cursor-link ~/projects/my-project
```

### 🚀 Option 3: Complete Setup
Configure a new or existing project:

```bash
# Current project with copy
cursor-setup

# Specific project with symlink
cursor-setup ~/projects/new-project link

# Current project with symlink
cursor-setup . link
```

cursor-edit

# Or manually
cursor ~/cursor-config/rules/
```

### Adding New Rule
1. Create a `.mdc` file in `~/cursor-config/rules/`
2. For projects with **symlink**: changes are automatic
3. For projects with **copy**: run `cursor-sync` to update

### Updating Projects
```bash
# For projects with symlink: automatic ✨
# For projects with copy:
cursor-sync ~/projects/project1
cursor-sync ~/projects/project2
```

## 🎯 Workflows

### 💼 For Personal Development
1. Use **symlinks** in all projects
2. Edit rules centrally
3. Changes applied automatically

```bash
# Initial setup
for project in ~/projects/*/; do
    cursor-link "$project"
done
```

### 👥 For Teams
1. Use **copy** to version rules with code
2. Centralize changes in this repository
3. Synchronize when needed

```bash
# Batch update
for project in ~/projects/*/; do
    cursor-sync "$project"
    cd "$project"
    git add .cursor/rules/
    git commit -m "chore: update cursor rules"
    cd -
done
```
